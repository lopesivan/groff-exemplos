What is a journey?
.br
A journey is not a trip.
It's not a vacation.
It's a process. A discovery.
It's a process of self-discovery.
A journey brings us face to face with ourselves.
A journey shows us not only the world,
but how we fit in it.
Does the person create the journey
or does the journey create the person?
The journey is life itself.
Where will life take you?
