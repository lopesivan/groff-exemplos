And outside the debate rages
Oil,
energy,
the environment

It is the story of our time
and it is definitive
and it's all encompassing
and it leaves no one untouched.

Because make no mistake.
This isn't just about oil companies.

This is about you and me
and the undeniable truth that at this moment there are 6.5 billion
people on this planet.

And by year's end there will be another 73 million
and every one of us will need energy to live.

Where will it come from?

This is our challenge each day.
Because for today and tomorrow
and the foreseeable future,
our lives demand oil.
But what's also true is that we can provide it more intelligently,
more efficiently,
more respectfully.

That we'll never stop looking for alternatives.
That an oil company can practice and espouse conservation.
Yes we are an oil company,
but right now we're also providing natural gas,
solar,
hydrogen,
geothermal...
Because we live on this planet too.

This is who we are.

In 180 countries.
Not corporate titans,
but men and women of vision.
58,000 citizens of the world.
Liberals and conservatives,
engineers and scientists,
pipeline welders and geologists,
husbands and wives,
part-time poets and coaches.
People who daily try to find newer ways,
cleaner ways,
to power the world.
Humans have always reached for what seemed impossible.
Because it is then that we find a way.

Tell us it can't be done
and watch as we tap the greatest source of energy in the world.

Ourselves.

This is the power of human energy.
